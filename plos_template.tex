\section*{Introduction}
Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are an easy and cheap way to find Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) which can be interesting because of their medical relevance. SNPs found through GWAS can be used to find candidate genes for a closer inspection or to predict disease risks. Genome Wide Association Studies make use of statistics to compare the alleles of patients to the alleles of healthy controls. By this the method does not allow to find causal differences but mere correlations. The first GWAS was published in 2005 and compared age-related macular degeneration in contrast to a healthy control group (doi:10.1126/science.1109557). Since the beginning the number of participants in those studies is rising and over 1200 GWAS have been performed (doi:10.1186/1471-2350-10-6.) and over 5000 SNPs have been linked to different diseases and traits in those studies %(http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageid=26525384&clearquery=1#result_table).

Since 2006 there are different companies like 23andMe, deCODEme or FamilyTreeDNA on the market which offer Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing. Those companies use DNA micro arrays to screen for around 1 million SNPs which are spread over the human genome. In return customers get an analysis of the results, as well as a raw file that includes the SNP-IDs and their respective allele for the customer. In 2011 23andMe alone had over 100.000 customers (http://spittoon.23andme.com/2011/06/15/23andme-2011-state-of-the-database-address/) and the company also recognizes the potential to do GWAS with that amount of data. They provide surveys to their customers that ask about traits and genetic diseases. With the consent of the customer those data will then be used for association studies. 23andMe published 3(?) articles in 2011 in which they replicate known findings but also find new associations for Parkinson's Disease. By activating their customer base they achieved to have over 30.000 individuals enrolled in those association studies.  

Although companies like 23andMe are willing to contribute to science it is not easy for individual scientists to get hold of the data. This arises mainly due to privacy concerns of the customers. A possible solution to this can be a crowdsourcing platform that aggregates genetical and phenotypical information of people who are willing to share their data with the general public and have given their informed consent. In our study we investigated if there would be interest in such a crowd sourcing platform, how many people would be willing to share their genetic and phenotypic information with the public and built such a platform.
